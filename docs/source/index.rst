Hi there!

Welcome to the Machine Learning 1 (ML1) course at MSc Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam.
This website is provided to you to help you familiarize yourself with the mathematics needed to get into the field of
machine learning. The content is divided into three parts, corresponding to the three mathematical foundations
of machine learning: linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and statistics.

If you see any errors on the site, please write us (or approach us when observed in the wild) and we will make sure to
address them as soon as possible. Moreover, please share this document with whoever might profit from it.
