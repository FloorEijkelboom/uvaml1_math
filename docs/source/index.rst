Mathematics for AI
==================


Hi there!

Welcome to the Machine Learning 1 (ML1) course here at MSc Artificial Intelligence from
the University of Amsterdam. These notes are provided to help you familiarize yourself with the
‘prior knowledge’ needed to follow the ML1 course. In practice, however, you will probably not know
all the material here, and please do not feel discouraged by that. We advise you to read through
these notes and see which things you already knew and which things you need to brush up on.

The document is divided into three parts: linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and a general introduction to machine learning. The first section aims to refresh your knowledge about vectors, matrices, linear transformations, determinants, bases, orthonormal projections, eigen decompositions,
and similar topics. The second section is focused on calculus in higher dimensions, essentially generalizing the derivative from standard (real) functions to real functions between higher-dimensional
Euclidean spaces. The last section will zoom into the machine learning problem, the actual reason
you are probably reading these notes, to begin with. It is a concise sketch of the general problem
you will be facing for the next weeks.

If you see any errors in this document, please write us and we will make sure to address them as soon
as possible. Moreover, feel free to share this document with whoever might profit from it. Good
luck with your studies!
